# Pre-work - *JustTheTip*

**JustTheTip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Kweku Nyadu Aboagye**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Implemented a fourth segmented control "Other" that allows user to manually input tip amount (to replace the default tip in the settings view controller)
